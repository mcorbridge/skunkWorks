# skunkWorks
Something stinks!  And I think it is this code.
This is a test harness app that allows me to create a separate module in which to test code.  As you are well aware, sometime you need to add new functionality to an existing complex app, and it doesn't make sense to shoehorn the code in to see if it works.  That's where skunkWorks comes in.  The angularJS based application allows you to create a space to try out new ideas, where all the necessary dependencies already available, like: angularJS, bootstrap, font awesome, gsap, jquery ... or whatever else you want.  Try it out here, and if it doesn't stink then add to your production app.  SkunkWorks: We may not look pretty, but at least we stink!
